      What are the lyrics to NSG 'Options'?

I make money online
I make money on time
I make money online
All my n***as got me makin' money online
I make money on time
Shawty wanna f**k but I give her no time (JAE5)

(Chorus - OGD)
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

(Verse 1 - Kruddz)
Money callin', money talkin'
Trap phone goin' ring ring
Trap phone buy me bling-bling, yeah
Where was you way back then?
I was doing stick up with my bad friends
Police had us twist up pon the landin'
Every other time mix up in violence

(Verse 2 - PapiiAbz)
Not just because of the bustdown
But I'm on the grind 'till I'm up now
Hustle in the blood, I'm a hustler
Tough striker call me Costa
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line ringin' all day
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line singin' all day

(Chorus - OGD)
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

(Verse 3 - Tion Wayne)
Ghetto and stylish
LV drop, man I rock it with sliders
Shopping abroad first day I'm off-license
Came fresh home first thing I done, diamonds
All about timin', wrist so blindin'
'Cause she's all boo'd up, man she got haters
We don't fly Europe, we just go Vegas
Man try draws her, she don't do strangers
F**k about status, uh
'Bout Corsa, put her in a Porcshe
Eyebrow sharpish, lookin' like my borer
Come a long way from chillin' on a corner
Fat ass, bloody hell that's torture
I ain't getting poorer
Always complain that she can't see me often
I just keep it real, I can't run out of option
I can see you're stressed out and you keep callin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'

(Chorus - OGD)
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

(Verse 4 - Mojo)
Amazing, all of this money I'm making
Nights on the back roads, didn't phase me
Did it for the culture where they raised me
About to make a move
Might have to sell food
Do what you gotta do
And tell the judge, "Free the goons"

(Verse 5 - OGD)
Put that loud pack in my loud pack
And I'm totin' it quick plus all of the gang
Baby girl you look familiar
Convo start and mi wan' fi get familiar
Girl,â€‹ I'm a trendy yute
Lemme put you in them new Fendi shoes
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
I can never be you, nah nah

(Chorus - OGD)
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you're gonna run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

(Outro - DopeBoy)
Makin' money
She said, "N***a, you don't make no time for me"
Because mi trap-trap 'til the early mornin'
And now they pray on the downfall of me
You can't take my shine
This shine makin' n***as close blinds
There's no stoppin' this grind
F**k around I'll take your pic to the shrine
